<h3>Cheetah "Facts"</h3>
<p>
Cheetahs are fast cats with a taste for the good life. They have grace and style but suffer from low genetic diversity. This problem resulted from a serious population bottleneck that ocurred somewhere on their migration from North America to Africa and Asia during the late Pleistocene.  
</p>
<p>
The fastest cheetah ever recorded was clocked at 90 MPH driving a '89 Jaguar with a missing rear bumper. It's unclear who gave that cheetah a driver's license.

<h3>Cheetah Story</h3>
<p>
This one time I was over at my friend Dee's house, having a snack. We heard this scratching at the door and Dee was like, "What? Scratching? Door?" 
</p>
<p>I totally wasn't scared. I knew it was a cheetah. I've got cheetah sense.</p>         
<p>
Anyway, we didn't open the door, just to be on the safe side, but you can imagine the kind of hijinks that might have resulted. We had a few snacks, discussed cheetah strategy and tried to draw what the cheetah must've looked like from the sound of his (or her) door scratching technique.
